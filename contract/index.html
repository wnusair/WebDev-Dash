<p><em>Revised 8/13/2024</em></p>

<p>This <strong>Student Conduct Contract and Parent Release Liability Form</strong> (“Contract”) provides an agreement between the Student (“Student”) participating in TechOlympics 2025 (“Conference”), P&amp;G Headquarters (“Venue”) the Student’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) (“Parent”), the school or organization accepting responsibility for the student while attending the Conference (“School”), and the INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati (“INTERalliance”). The parties whose signatures appear below have read the terms of this Contract, understand all the rules and restrictions stated and implied, agree to abide by these requirements without compromise, and to provide the indicated releases. The parties understand that violations of this Contract may result in immediate expulsion from the Conference at the sole discretion of INTERalliance, with further consequences determined by officials and official policies of the school the student is representing. If dismissed for a violation of this Contract, the Student will be expected to leave the Venue accompanied by their Parent or their designee immediately, but no later than 90 minutes after notification to the Parent that the Student has been expelled from the Conference. At all times while attending and participating in the Conference, the following rules and permissions apply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong> — The Student understands that they are acting as an ambassador for their high school and INTERalliance, and promises to act in a mature, responsible manner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LANGUAGE AND BEHAVIOR</strong> — The Student will refrain from using lewd, profane, off-color or inappropriate language or exhibiting any lewd or inappropriate behavior, including inappropriate text messaging, emailing, posting to social media sites as well as the TechOlympics Whova discussions board, or related communications to peers on- or off-site. This will result in immediate removal from TechOlympics and all future INTERalliance related activities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PERSONAL BELONGINGS, CASH, AND ELECTRONICS</strong> — The Student is not to bring items of high personal value to the Conference. The INTERalliance, its sponsors, directors, employees, and volunteers, and the Venue are not responsible for any personal items brought by the Student that are lost, stolen, or broken during the Conference. The Student is discouraged from bringing to the Conference any personal electronic equipment or items of value, including gaming equipment, iPods, laptops, tablets, radios, calculators, televisions, etc. The Student may bring a personal cell phone, but the use of this device must be limited to those activities deemed appropriate by INTERalliance at its sole discretion. If inappropriate use of a cell phone is determined by INTERalliance, the Student will be required to relinquish the cell phone to their school representative or INTERalliance staff until it is returned to Student prior to departing from the Venue at the conclusion of the Conference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>APPROPRIATE USE OF EQUIPMENT</strong> — The Student will only utilize PCs issued for use during the Conference in approved ways, refraining from accessing online e-commerce sites (eBay, iTunes, etc.) or adult and inappropriate content sites of any kind, or inappropriate content on any site including YouTube. Unauthorized use of provided computers will result in disciplinary action up to expulsion from the Conference at the sole discretion of INTERalliance. For more information, Students may refer to the <a href="https://interalliance.org/policy">INTERalliance Acceptable Use Policy</a> for additional details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WHOVA COURTESY</strong> — While using Whova, all participants must use appropriate language, and be respectful and mindful of other participants, moderators, and presenters. If in any case the student is misusing Whova, whether this be through spamming, inappropriate messaging/language, or disrespect shown towards others, this will result in disciplinary action up to expulsion from the Conference at the sole discretion of INTERalliance, and/or communication to said student’s school administration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DRESS CODE</strong> — The Student must wear only modest, non-revealing clothing appropriate for meeting with university and corporate adult representatives during the Conference, as determined to be appropriate by the INTERalliance and its staff. Violation of this requirement will result in the Student being immediately required to change into appropriate clothing and, if necessary, required to return home to secure such appropriate attire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>STAYING ON-SITE</strong> — The Student will remain on-site at the Venue at all times during the Conference, and will only enter approved areas of the Venue. Any and all rooms and areas/wings of the Venue assigned to members of the opposite gender are off limits at all times. Students will require written approval from their Parent to exit the Venue outside before the event has concluded, and requires physical sign-out by a Parent or their designee onsite at the Conference. Students need not (and are not permitted to) exit the building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BULLYING</strong> — The INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati will not tolerate behavior that infringes on the safety of any student. A student shall not intimidate, harass, or bully another student through words or actions. Such behavior includes direct physical contact, such as hitting or shoving; verbal assaults, such as teasing or name-calling; and social isolation or manipulation. The INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati expects students and/or staff to immediately report bullying incidents to the Executive Director of the INTERalliance Board of Directors. Staff who witness such acts take immediate steps to intervene when safe to do so. Each complaint of bullying should be promptly investigated. This policy applies to students during an INTERalliance-sponsored activity (including ILC, TechOlympics, Training Programs, the INTERalliance Intern Program, and any other INTERalliance Sponsored Event or Program). The INTERalliance bullying policy also extends to online harassment and cyberbullying when INTERalliance students are involved. Students who bully violate this policy and are subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DISCRIMINATION</strong> — The Student shall not take part in or facilitate discrimination of any kind, including, but not limited to, discrimination based on gender, race, national origin, ethnicity, age, religion, sexual orientation, disability, handicap, or intelligence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RELEASE OF LIABILITY</strong> — The undersigned Student and Parent hereby holds INTERalliance, its sponsors, directors, employees, trustees, officers, volunteers and agents harmless from any claims, damages, losses and/or expenses arising out of participation by the Student or the Parent in the Conference and assumes all liability for any and all personal injury, bodily injury, illness or property damage that occurs as a result of Student’s participation in Conference’s activities. The parties warrant that participation in this Conference is voluntary and that Student and Parent have read and understand that the inherent risks exist despite the Conference’s safety precautions and procedures. The Student agrees to obey all rules and policies mandated by their school staff representative, the INTERalliance, the Venue, and associated authorities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PHOTO CONSENT</strong> — INTERalliance activities and events may be photographed or videotaped for publication in INTERalliance information and promotional materials. The Student’s Parent’s signature below provides a media release allowing the name, school, and photo likeness or video image of the Student to be used for documentation or promotional purposes by the INTERalliance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE</strong> — In the unexpected event that emergency medical care is necessary, Parent hereby authorize INTERalliance, supervising staff from Student’s school, and/or staff of the Venue to implement standard First Aid, considering the special needs identified, and, if necessary, to transport the Student to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital for emergency care while concurrently attempting to contact the Emergency Contact individuals indicated during Conference registration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY</strong> — TechOlympics is committed to maintaining a safe and entertaining event, free from the illegal drugs or alcohol to protect the health and safety of our attendees and volunteers. Identification of illegal drugs or alcohol possession will result in expulsion from the Conference, and parents will be notified immediately. Any illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia will be turned over to an appropriate law enforcement agency and may result in criminal prosecution.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
