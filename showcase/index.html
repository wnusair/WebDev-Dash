        Showcase Project Information
    </h1>
    <hr class="divide">
    <p>
        Each year, the TechOlympics Showcase is a central part of our technology competition and event. Schools work on
        their Showcase projects with their coach during the November to February timeframe, then present their projects
        as a team in front of our panel of executive judges from all over Cincinnati’s business community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a project in one of these categories to earn points for your school in the 2025 TechOlympics
        Showcase. Use these as inspiration, but the sky’s the limit for what you can do. You will present this project
        to a panel of expert judges at TechOlympics 2025 in February.
    </p>
    <p>
        The winning project of the TechOlympics showcase will have the chance to present their project to all other
        attendees and even at an INTERalliance board meeting!

    <h1 tabindex="0">Project Requirements</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each school can only submit 1 showcase project and up to 5 representatives from the school must attend the
            conference in order to present the project although any number of students may work on the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            The project must be original and must have been started at some point in the 2023-24 school year, and must
            contain a slideshow to be presented.
        </li>
        <li>
            Projects should be substantial. If a high level of effort is apparent when your project is being judged,
            your project will earn more points. Think outside the box, cover all your bases, and use a team to divide a
            huge project into small pieces so your school can succeed. The winning project of the TechOlympics showcase
            will have the opportunity to present their project in front of over 500 of their peers!

    <h1 tabindex="0">Best Practices</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            While a working prototype is not required, it is highly encouraged. A working prototype will help to
            eliminate ambiguities and improve accuracy in interpretation of the project requirements and functionality.

        </li>
        <li>
            Providing judges with a workflow/development process will give them a heightened sense of how your project
            came to fruition. This may include the: tasks and requirements which constitute a process & the people or
            resources required to deliver this process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Similar to a workflow, a data/application flow will help judges follow the actual functionality and flow of
            information for your process or system. This is simply an overview that should be able to be elaborated
            upon.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition to your core project, it is advised to develop a business and marketing plan if applicable. This
            will convey your forward-looking approach and show a practical plan for advancing your idea.

        <p><strong tabindex="0">Project Category: </strong>Event Theme: Empower</p>
        <p><strong tabindex="0">Project Description: </strong>The search and rescue coordinator serves as a method to make a live map of clues in order to help on field search teams and mission control in an urban search and rescue environment. The physical prototype is easily attached to a hiking stick and contains GPS equipment that is more accurate than a smartphone. When the button on the prototype is pressed, the coordinates of the clue are sent to a google sheet database that assigns a clue name from the phonetic alphabet. All live locations and coordinates are available on the website in both map and standard coordinate form. The website also contains information on basic first aid guides and search and rescue techniques. This allows even volunteers with no skill to better help the teams. The project itself has room to grow and there are many ideas the team has developed for future expansions.</p>
        <p><strong tabindex="0">Funding, Resources, and Technology Comments: </strong>All funding was provided by the school from last year's competition. 3d printers, owned by both students and the school, were used. List of used hardware: Raspberry Pi, breadboard, GPS Arduino, GPS antenna, and connection cables. Also, a wooden hiking stick was used. For software: there are parts programmed in python and a website programmed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <p><strong tabindex="0">Project Description: </strong>In the last 10 years, over 2 million people have been injured in natural disasters worldwide. The aftermath of such disasters creates treacherous terrains, making search and rescue operations challenging. Our solution is SAVIOR (Search and Amphibious Vehicle for Immediate Operational Rescue): a remote operated, amphibious vehicle equipped with a GPS, camera, and medical supplies. An Arduino system will manage the onboard sensors. A Spektrum DX6 radio receiver will allow the operator to maneuver the robot, manage a camera, and access a radio. Additionally, since limb lacerations are the most common form of injury in natural disasters, SAVIOR will come equipped with tourniquets, gauze, bandages, etc. To continue incorporating STEM methods, engineering strategies such as materials testing and CAD modeling will be a vital part of the preliminary design, and math will be used to ensure a reasonable weight and buoyancy. Embracing innovation, safeguarding humanity, SAVIOR solves for tomorrow.</p>
        <p><strong tabindex="0">Funding, Resources, and Technology Comments: </strong>The group used an Arduino, relays, motor drivers, low gauge wires, voltage converters, and Dewalt batteries.

        <p><strong tabindex="0">Project Category: </strong>Event Theme: Empower</p>
        <p><strong tabindex="0">Project Description: </strong>I.R.I.S., or Illuminated Rain-shielding Inclusive Support, is a futuristic invention designed to increase personal mobility and safety in urban and college-campus environments. This innovative design is a prototype for an umbrella that integrates Arduino-programmed LED lights into its framework to provide a steady light that enhances visibility in low-light conditions, improving safety for users navigating through busy city streets or poorly lit areas. The LED lights not only serve as a safety measure but also illuminate the user's surroundings, offering a wider range of vision and keeping them more situationally aware.
Another one of I.R.I.S.'s main attractions is its CAD-designed backpack insert, allowing users to carry the umbrella in a backpack compartment. This portability feature is convenient and enables individuals to carry their umbrella and keep both hands free of unnecessary burdens. Similar to its LED lights, the hands-free portion of the umbrella also enhances the safety of the user so they can always be physically prepared for whatever comes their way.
In any bustling outdoor environment, we envision that I.R.I.S. will become an indispensable companion. Its dual functionality as a rain shield and a source of illumination empowers users to move more confidently and safely than ever before. Whether navigating alone at night or along dimly-lit streets, I.R.I.S. ensures that users can be free to pursue their tasks and dreams without worrying about threats to their well-being.
Embrace the future of safety and mobility with I.R.I.S., creating a world in which you can 'walk boldly and dream brightly.' </p>
        <p><strong tabindex="0">Funding, Resources, and Technology Comments: </strong>Technologies: We used CAD-design to 3-D print the support and Arduino to program the LED lights. Resources: We used the school's 3D printer and a plethora of physical materials to build the prototype, and Canva (free) to make the presentation. Funding: The student president donated some of the materials and the other materials were from resources available to IHHS students.</p>
